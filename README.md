# Coffee Shop 

App concept created with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) using Dart programming language.

## About

This is an UI for a Coffee Shop app, that helps the customer to enter the app Products, choose any one he want and look for it's details. 
i used Provider State managment to deliver the data through the application, and used Flutter Material widgets for designing.

### Design Details
the whole UI is inspiring for [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) website and helped me a lot with new ideas.

### Database and Storage
I used Firebase Realtime database to store the products and handel the Authentications of the application, and only one admin can write (modify, add and delete products)
and the rest of the users only can read.
the admin account (E-mail: test@test.com & Password: 123456)
