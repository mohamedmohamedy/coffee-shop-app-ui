# Coffee Shop UI

App concept created with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) using Dart programming language.

## About

This is an UI for a Coffee Shop app, that helps the customer to enter the app Products, choose any one he want and look for it's details. 
i used Provider State managment to deliver the data through the applicaaion, amd used Flutter Material widgets for designing.

### Design Details
the whole UI is inspiring for [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) website and helped me a lot with new ideas.
